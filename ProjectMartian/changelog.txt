- Created a dungeon generation function (generateLayout) that randomly assigns positions to rooms within a 5x2 grid.
- i.e. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
       [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
- Created the entrance function, which consists of the first temple room before the randomly generated layout. This
  function uses the player's intelligence stat to determine the mana points available to them and gives them two starter spells:
  fireball (a damaging spell) and restoration (a healing spell).
